# draw 10 random means, create 10 probability distr around these, sd = 1

# Q values, init as 0, updated at each time t

# Two execution loops, 2000 iteration, time step 1/1000
# each step, either greedy or epsilon, and draw a reward from the distributions, update Q for that action.

# Store each reward in a matrix, plot average
